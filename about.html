                    <!-- <h2>Project Overview</h2> -->
                    <p>Shifting LGBTQ+ Spaces is an effort by a team of faculty and students at the University of
                        Washington to build and eventually analyze a nationwide data base of LGBTQ+ spaces and places in
                        the U.S.from the mid-1960s through the mid-2010s. The data base is meant to be expandable to the
                        present but for the moment is focused on the time period indicated. Our project is funded by the
                        National Science Foundation (Grant #1951072) with support from the UW Center for Studies in
                        Demography & Ecology, the UW Department of Geography, the UW Humanistic GIS Laboratory, and the
                        University of Washington Tacoma. We invite contributions and corrections to the data from
                        visitors to this site (see instructions below) and welcome other kinds of feedback as well. Feel
                        free to use the tools we offer here or you can contact us directly at xxxx@uw.edu.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <h2>Data</h2>
                    <p>We have begun construction of the data base by consulting local experts in various localities,
                        collaborating with colleagues elsewhere who have worked with similar data (a shoutout to our
                        friends at mappingthegayguides.org!), and extracting data from LGBTQ+ travel guides published
                        from the 1960s through the mid-2010s. We recognize that the accuracy of this sort of
                        information, from these sorts of sources, will always be both uncertain and contested. For this
                        reason we try to "ground truth" as much of the data as possible (using a variety of methods) and
                        have included an indication for each piece of data as to how accurate we believe it to be. Your
                        contributions to this process will help immensely with that process!

                        state level. From this map, you can click
                        on a county and see six infographics. These infographics are:</p>
                    <ul style="">
                        <li>a line graph showing COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 deaths and number of hospitalizations
                            associated with COVID-19 within that county.</li>

                        <li>a ranking of the 10 occupations which are currently hiring the most in that county.</li>
                        <li>a scatterplot showing occupational risk. This scatterplot takes data from the Bureau of
                            Labor Statistics which calculates exposure to disease or infections and physical proximity
                            on a scale of 0-100. Across the x-axis is exposure to
                            disease or infections ("How often does this job require exposure to disease/infections?"),
                            and across the y-axis is ("To what extent does this job require the worker to perform job
                            tasks in close physical proximity to other people?").
                            You can use the drop-down menu to choose an occupation and see the risk level. Or you can
                            hover over points on the scatter plot to see what occupation it represents.

                        1. Viewing the map of LGBTQ+ venues in urban spaces of major U.S. cities
                    </h4>

                    <p>This platform features a map* showing venues in our database.
                      At the top-left is a “time slider” (for choosing the year you want to look at).</p>
                    <br>At the top-right are a “Filter” button (for viewing types or characteristics of venues),
                      a “Localities” button (for choosing the city you want to view”), and a locality “Search” button.**</p>
                    <p>You can switch the “base map” to a current satellite image by hovering over the map below the “+”
                      sign on the bottom-right and clicking on the satellite image button.</p>
                    <p>Venues are shown as cones on the map.  Click on a cone to view a profile of the venue it represents.
                      A panel will appear on the left of the map with the profile.</p>
                    <p>At the bottom of the profile you can also suggest an edit, review the venue, or close the panel.
                      Finally, at the bottom-right of the map is a “+” sign that you can click on to suggest a venue that does not appear in our database.</p>
                    <p>*Please note that while the map shows venues between 1965-2014, the “base map” is comprised of today’s street grid and landscapes,
                      so some venues – particularly from older years – may not be in their precise locations.</p>
                    <p>**Please note that currently we only have data uploaded for four U.S. cities (Atlanta, Cleveland, Nashville, and Seattle).
                      We will add more cities over time.</p>
                    <h4>2. Making Contributions to the Database</h4>
                    <p>You can make two types of contributions to this database: adding a missing venue or suggesting an edit to an existing venue.
                      To protect your privacy, we are NOT asking you to login to the portal in a way that results in any personal information
                      about you being collected. Instead, you will need to log in to the platform using a temporary passphrase.
                      If you do not already have a passphrase, <a target="_self" href="agreement.html">click here to obtain one</a>.  Once you have a passphrase,
                      click the log in button at the top-right of the map. A login panel will pop up.  Then simply input the three terms of the passphrase
                      and click “log in”. A notice will appear indicating that you have successfully logged in.  If the login fails, please try again
                      or contact us for help at XXX@uw.edu.</p>

                      <p>To add a missing venue, click the “+” button at the bottom-right of the main map. A panel will then open
                        where you can make your contribution.  To suggest an edit to an existing venue, click on the cone representing
                        the venue on the map.  A panel will again open where you can suggest an edit.  Just click on the “Suggest an edit”
                        button at the bottom of the panel. Click the “Submit” button when you are done.  Please note that your contribution
                        will not immediately appear on the map, as it takes time to process contributions. </p>
                    <h4>3. Downloading Data</h4>
