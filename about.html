                    <p>Shifting LGBTQ+ Spaces is an effort by a team of faculty and students at the University of
                        Washington to build and eventually analyze a nationwide data base of LGBTQ+ spaces and places in
                        the U.S.from the mid-1960s through the mid-2010s. The data base is meant to be expandable to the
                        present but for the moment is focused on the time period indicated. Our project is funded by the
                        National Science Foundation (Grant #1951072) with support from the UW Center for Studies in
                        Demography & Ecology, the UW Department of Geography, the UW Humanistic GIS Laboratory, and the
                        University of Washington Tacoma. We invite contributions and corrections to the data from
                        visitors to this site (see instructions below) and welcome other kinds of feedback as well. Feel
                        free to use the tools we offer here or you can contact us directly at xxxx@uw.edu.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Data</h2>
                    <p>We have begun construction of the data base by consulting local experts in various localities,
                        collaborating with colleagues elsewhere who have worked with similar data (a shoutout to our
                        friends at mappingthegayguides.org!), and extracting data from LGBTQ+ travel guides published
                        from the 1960s through the mid-2010s. We recognize that the accuracy of this sort of
                        information, from these sorts of sources, will always be both uncertain and contested. For this
                        reason we try to "ground truth" as much of the data as possible (using a variety of methods) and
                        have included an indication for each piece of data as to how accurate we believe it to be. Your
                        contributions to this process will help immensely with that process!"
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p>On the dashboard page, you will be immediately directed to a choropleth map which shows our
                        overall risk matrix for each county. This matrix was calculated by... This map view can be
                        changed to view infection risk, unemployment risk,
                        and occupation risk, by clicking on the appropriate tap above the map. On the dashboard you will
                        see infographics which show COVID risk and unemployment over time, and occupational risk at the
                        state level. From this map, you can click
                        on a county and see six infographics. These infographics are:</p>
                    <ul style="">
                        <li>a line graph showing COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 deaths and number of hospitalizations
                            associated with COVID-19 within that county.</li>
                        <li>a wordcloud which summarizes key terms which appeared in social media content about COVID-19
                            in that county. </li>
                        <li>a line graph showing the unemployment rate in that county throughout 2020.</li>
                        <li>the most recent unemployment insurance benefit per claimant in the county.</li>
                        <li>a ranking of the 10 occupations which are currently hiring the most in that county.</li>
                        <li>a scatterplot showing occupational risk. This scatterplot takes data from the Bureau of
                            Labor Statistics which calculates exposure to disease or infections and physical proximity
                            on a scale of 0-100. Across the x-axis is exposure to
                            disease or infections ("How often does this job require exposure to disease/infections?"),
                            and across the y-axis is ("To what extent does this job require the worker to perform job
                            tasks in close physical proximity to other people?").
                            You can use the drop-down menu to choose an occupation and see the risk level. Or you can
                            hover over points on the scatter plot to see what occupation it represents.

                    <h2>How to use this platform?</h2>

                    <p>This geospatial platform is featured with three functions that enables its users i）to view the
                        LGBTQ+ venues in urban spaces of major U.S. cities, ii）to contribute local knowledge about these
                        venues to the database if the database can be improved, and iii）to download the the database
                        when requested.
                        Below, we will introduce each of three major functions one by one.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        1. Viewing the map of LGBTQ+ venues in urban spaces of major U.S. cities

                    </h4>
                    This platform visualizes the venues on an interactive map. The graphic user interface is comprised
                    by a topbar and a main panel.

                    <p>The topbar shows the platform logo and name to its left, and a list of web pages on its right,
                        including map, team, about, feedback and log in. A platform users can choose between these pages
                        to view the map, check the team who develops and maintain this project, read the project
                        description, provide feedback, and log in to the platform in order to make contributions.</p>

                    <p>Right below the topbar is the main map. The map is comprised of a base layer and a layer of
                        venues. The base map is made up using OpenStreetmap by Mapbox. It is worth noting that, in
                        current version of the platform, the base map only displays a map of today; it could not be
                        changed to plot historical land features of the the year indicated on the top left corner of the
                        main panel. A user can overlay two different types of basemap, one is the default grayscale map,
                        and the other is a satellite imagery. A user can chage the base map by operating the layer
                        switcher at the bottom right corner of the main map. On the map, each venue is illustrated as a
                        three-dimensional cone. After clicking upon the cone, a panel of the venue profile will be shown
                        to the left of the main map. </p>

                    <p>The time slider kit is at the top left corner of the main map. A user can slide the timeline to
                        view the venue map of a specific year between 1965 to 2014.

                    <p>The top right corner of the main map lies a list of toolkits. the Filter dropdown menu allows a
                        user to filter the venue by selected descriptors. For example, if the “Bar/Nightclub” is chosen,
                        only the venues that have been considered as a bar/nightclub will be plotted on the interactive
                        map. The Localities menu allows users to fly to a different locale. We will keep improve the
                        platform by providing data from more locales, at this moment, it has dataset from Seattle,
                        Atlanta, Nashville, and Cleveland. Right next to the Locality dropdown menu is a geocoder bar
                        that allows users to search a local place and then get to there for a closer view of the map of
                        nearby venues. The question mark icon can initiate a walkthrough of the geospatial platform.</p>

                    <p>At the bottom left shows the logos and a short acknowledgement. Right above them is the legend
                        button. A user can turn on or off the visualization of venues by toggling on or off the
                        switcher. If clicking the legend bar, a detailed legend panel will be displayed. The table lists
                        a group of venues, the location of which cannot be easily located on the map. A few examples of
                        such venues are P.O. Boxes, Radio Stations, magazines. A user can also turn on or off the
                        confident level switcher to color the venues by how confident we are about data accuracy. </p>

                    <p>The bottom right corner of the main map lies the adding a missing venue button (or the adding
                        venue button thereafter) and the layer swticher. The adding venue button will enable a user to
                        add a venue that does not exist in the database. </p>
                    <h4>2. Making contribution to the database</h4>
                    <p>You can make two primary types of contributions to this database: adding a missing venue or
                        suggesting an edit to an existing venue. To protect your privacy, we are NOT asking you to login
                        to the portal in a way that results in any personal information about you being collected.
                        Instead, you will need to log in to the platform using the temporary passphrase. To do so,
                        clicking the log in button to the right of the topbar. On the displaying log in panel, you can
                        input the three terms of the passphrase, and click “log in”. A notice will appear to indicate
                        that you have successfully logged in or not.</p>

                    <p>If a user realizes that a venue is missing in the database, this user can contribute this venue
                        through the platform. After clicking the “adding venue” button to the buttom left corner of the
                        main map, a user can open the adding venue mode. In this mode, a left panel will display on the
                        left of the main map, it assists a user to input the features of the missing venue. If a user
                        realizes that some edits of an existing venue is needed, this user can click on the “suggest an
                        edit” button on the bottom of the profile panel of a venue. Then, a user can suggest edits to a
                        venue. For both operations, the newly made contribution will not immediately appear on the map.
                        In other words, a user cannot see its edits on the map immediately, please do not get panic
                        since the research will review your contribution first and then improve the database by a
                        holistic consideration of all the contributions.</p>
                    <h4>3. Download the database when requested</h4>
                    <p>A user can download venue data of each locality in the format of geojson or csv. To do so, a user
                        needs to sign a user contract. After our approval, a temporary link for data downloading will be
                        shared with the applicant.</p>
