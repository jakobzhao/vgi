                    <p>Shifting LGBTQ+ Spaces is an effort by a team of faculty and students at the University of Washington to build and eventually analyze a nationwide data base of LGBTQ+ spaces and places in the U.S.from the mid-1960s through the mid-2010s.  The data base is meant to be expandable to the present but for the moment is focused on the time period indicated.  Our project is funded by the National Science Foundation (Grant #1951072) with support from the UW Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology, the UW Department of Geography, the UW Humanistic GIS Laboratory, and the University of Washington Tacoma.  We invite contributions and corrections to the data from visitors to this site (see instructions below) and welcome other kinds of feedback as well.  Feel free to use the tools we offer here or you can contact us directly at xxxx@uw.edu.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Data</h2>
                    <p>We have begun construction of the data base by consulting local experts in various localities, collaborating with colleagues elsewhere who have worked with similar data (a shoutout to our friends at mappingthegayguides.org!), and extracting data from LGBTQ+ travel guides published from the 1960s through the mid-2010s.  We recognize that the accuracy of this sort of information, from these sorts of sources, will always be both uncertain and contested.  For this reason we try to "ground truth" as much of the data as possible (using a variety of methods) and have included an indication for each piece of data as to how accurate we believe it to be.  Your contributions to this process will help immensely with that process!"
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p>On the dashboard page, you will be immediately directed to a choropleth map which shows our
                        overall risk matrix for each county. This matrix was calculated by... This map view can be
                        changed to view infection risk, unemployment risk,
                        and occupation risk, by clicking on the appropriate tap above the map. On the dashboard you will
                        see infographics which show COVID risk and unemployment over time, and occupational risk at the
                        state level. From this map, you can click
                        on a county and see six infographics. These infographics are:</p>
                    <ul style="">
                        <li>a line graph showing COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 deaths and number of hospitalizations
                            associated with COVID-19 within that county.</li>
                        <li>a wordcloud which summarizes key terms which appeared in social media content about COVID-19
                            in that county. </li>
                        <li>a line graph showing the unemployment rate in that county throughout 2020.</li>
                        <li>the most recent unemployment insurance benefit per claimant in the county.</li>
                        <li>a ranking of the 10 occupations which are currently hiring the most in that county.</li>
                        <li>a scatterplot showing occupational risk. This scatterplot takes data from the Bureau of
                            Labor Statistics which calculates exposure to disease or infections and physical proximity
                            on a scale of 0-100. Across the x-axis is exposure to
                            disease or infections ("How often does this job require exposure to disease/infections?"),
                            and across the y-axis is ("To what extent does this job require the worker to perform job
                            tasks in close physical proximity to other people?").
                            You can use the drop-down menu to choose an occupation and see the risk level. Or you can
                            hover over points on the scatter plot to see what occupation it represents.
