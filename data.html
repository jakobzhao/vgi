                    <p>We have begun construction of the data base by consulting local experts in various localities,
                        collaborating with colleagues elsewhere who have worked with similar data (a shoutout to our
                        friends at mappingthegayguides.org!), and extracting data from LGBTQ+ travel guides published
                        from the 1960s through the mid-2010s. We recognize that the accuracy of this sort of
                        information, from these sorts of sources, will always be both uncertain and contested. For this
                        reason we try to "ground truth" as much of the data as possible (using a variety of methods) and
                        have included an indication for each piece of data as to how accurate we believe it to be. Your
                        contributions to this process will help immensely with that process!

                        changed to view infection risk, unemployment risk,
                        and occupation risk, by clicking on the appropriate tap above the map. On the dashboard you will
                        see infographics which show COVID risk and unemployment over time, and occupational risk at the
                        state level. From this map, you can click
                        on a county and see six infographics. These infographics are:</p>
                    <ul style="">
                        <li>a line graph showing COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 deaths and number of hospitalizations
                            associated with COVID-19 within that county.</li>
                        <li>a wordcloud which summarizes key terms which appeared in social media content about COVID-19
                            in that county. </li>
                        <li>a line graph showing the unemployment rate in that county throughout 2020.</li>
                        <li>the most recent unemployment insurance benefit per claimant in the county.</li>
                        <li>a ranking of the 10 occupations which are currently hiring the most in that county.</li>
                        <li>a scatterplot showing occupational risk. This scatterplot takes data from the Bureau of
                            Labor Statistics which calculates exposure to disease or infections and physical proximity
                            on a scale of 0-100. Across the x-axis is exposure to
                            disease or infections ("How often does this job require exposure to disease/infections?"),
                            and across the y-axis is ("To what extent does this job require the worker to perform job
                            tasks in close physical proximity to other people?").
                            You can use the drop-down menu to choose an occupation and see the risk level. Or you can
                            hover over points on the scatter plot to see what occupation it represents.
