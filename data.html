              <span>We have begun construction of the data base by consulting local experts in various localities,
                collaborating with colleagues elsewhere who have worked with similar data (a shoutout to our
                friends at <a href="https://www.mappingthegayguides.org/">mappingthegayguides.org<a>!), and extracting
                    data from LGBTQ+ travel guides published
                    from the 1960s through the mid-2010s. We recognize that the accuracy of this sort of
                    information, from these sorts of sources, will always be both uncertain and contested. For this
                    reason we try to "ground truth" as much of the data as possible (using a variety of methods) and
                    have included an indication for each piece of data as to how accurate we believe it to be. Your
                    contributions to this process will help immensely with that process!

              <span id="note1"><sup>1</sup> The reason there are two systems of classification is that historically the
                LGBTQ+ community has faced
                countless discrimination using obscure or coded language to communicate was a way of combating social
                stigma. Our data sources
                too made use of coded language for their listings. However, as the meanings of some of these symbols and
                codes changed over time, they can be
                very inconsistent from year to year, this is especially true since earlier publications sometimes
                contained degoratory/discriminatory
                phrasings by today's standards. We have developed a modern classification system using some of those
                code words as the basis,
                which better reflects our values. However the old codes are kept as part of the dataset for those who
                may have use for it.</span>
