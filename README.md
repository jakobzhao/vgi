> Biangles by Liz Nania

The biangles were designed by Liz Nania as she was co-organising the first national bisexual contingent for the 1987 March on Washington. To me they are a powerful expression of the cleverness of LGBTQ design.

The design takes the triangle as a starting point. The pink triangle was used by the Nazis during world war two to mark male homosexuals. Lesbians were categorised with a black triangle with other "asocials" such as sex workers and "nonconformists".

**Nania overlapped pink and blue triangles, each representative of a pole of the normative gender binary. ** The space of their overlap is a deep purple, made from the combination of pink and blue. This overlap communicates an inclusivity in terms of the potentially adored –playing with powerful LGBTQ symbology. Later, it became the foundation for a striped flag, using the same colours, created by Michael Page.
