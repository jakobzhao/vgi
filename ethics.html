              <h2>What are some of the ethical issues involved in developing and using this database and geospatial platform?
              </h2>

              <p>A number of ethical issues have been important for us as researchers in developing and using this database and geospatial platform.  Others potentially involve you as visitors to this site, users of the data and maps contained herein, and as potential contributors.
              </p>

              <h2>Ethical Guidelines for the Researchers: Developing this Database and Geospatial Platform</h2>

              <p>As researchers, we strive for the most valid and reliable data and maps possible.  We therefore do as thorough a job as possible of verifying and accurately visualizing the data we collect.  That said, 100% accuracy is impossible – particularly for data that is derived from older sources or from people’s uncertain memories.  This is one reason that we have included an indicator of our and contributors’ levels of confidence in various data points.  In addition, we recognize that Damron guides, as an initial source of data, are imperfect and unequal in several ways (see our Design and Methods banner link). While we seek to address those deficiencies by incorporating data from additional sources, no database or map will ever be perfect.  Our aim is to document and visualize LGBTQ+ spaces as well as we can and to constantly improve on what is currently available.
              </p>

              <p>In addition to 100% accuracy being impossible, we also recognize that 100% objectivity is impossible.  Queeer space is by definition queer: sometimes it is fleeting, shape-shifting, multi-scalar or mobile.  It may hold different if not opposite meanings or significance for different people.  Sometimes it is not always visible or accessible to everyone.  Moreover, our own identities (and those of potential contributors) shape the data and visualizations we produce.  We are therefore committed to a diversity of team members and contributors, critical reflection about blindspots, erasures, and misrepresentations.  We especially seek the knowledge, expertise, and perspectives of marginalized folks in developing and visualizing the data.
              </p>

              <p>It is important to note that there is no deception in the way we have designed this project.  We are up front and candid about its nature as well as about who we are, our aims and objectives.  If our maps are "wrong" to you, we seek the information you have to make them more accurate (see below).  The database, our maps, and any analysis we do are always in process, not definitive.
              </p>

              <p>Accordingly, we recognize that while that data we collect and visualize is from multiple sources, and cannot be 100% accurate or objective, we are ultimately responsible for the data we make available and the visualizations provided via our platform.  Therefore we have not just the right but the responsibility to continually revise and improve the accuracy of the data and visualizations thereof, as well to insure as diverse a range of data and understandings of it as possible.  Our accountability to visitors, users, and contributors therefore also involves making the database and visualizations of it available to community members, as well as scholars and activists.
              </p>

              <p>Finally, we are committed to being transparent in how we visualize and analyze this data (see the Design and Methodology link in the banner above).  We will always present and report all of our findings fully and without favor, regardless of whether they are "positive" or "negative" results.
              </p>

              <h2>Ethical Guidelines Regarding Use of Contributed Data: How We Protect Contributors to this Database and Platform
              </h2>

              <p>Contributing to this database is entirely voluntary.  We are not forcing anyone to contribute, and want to be clear that no one should contribute who might for any reason find doing so disturbing or upsetting.  We also are committed to protecting your safety and anonymity.  Hence we are neither collecting nor requesting any personal data from visitors or contributors, and discourage you from providing it.  At the same time, we cannot prohibit self-disclosure of personal information.  If you feel the need to communicate with us about a potential contribution (or any other matter related to this project), without remaining anonymous, please contact us through the feedback form.
              </p>

              <p>Any information you provide will remain confidential and anonymous.  This means that particular contributions will not be linked to individuals and any voluntary disclosure of personal or identifying information will not be shared outside of the research team.  Also, all data provided by contributors will be reviewed and synthesized before being visualized or analyzed.  This process will further lower the possibility of exposing self-disclosure identification and personal information.
              </p>

              <p>We also have an obligation to protect the integrity of the data, visualizations, and project overall.  Towards that end, we are asking contributors, despite their anonymity, to affirm their own commitment to engage with this site and platform ethically by clicking on an “ethical agreement” (see below).
              </p>

              <p>We also recognize that accessing and visualizing data about LGBTQ+ spaces can be risky for third parties, especially people who might have a connection to those spaces.  This is another reason that we do our best to verify not just the accuracy of data but the willingness of people associated with those spaces to have their locations “outed”.  it is also why we have potential contributors click on an “ethical agreement” before providing data.
              </p>

              <p>Finally, we recognize that the inclusion of some data may be objectionable to some folks.  It may make visible vulnerable spaces or populations or otherwise put people associated with those spaces at risk.  We therefore may decline to accept some contributions and welcome comments from users who have this concern about their or someone else’s contributions.
              </p>

              <h2>Ethical Guidelines for Potential Visitors, Data and Map Users, and/or Contributors to the Database
              </h2>

              <p>First and foremost, visitors to this site, users of the data and maps, and potential contributors should carefully read and consider the “ethical agreement” statement and agree to it before providing any data.  It is important that you understand fully the goals of this project and that you affirm the same commitment to protecting the safety, confidentiality, and anonymity of users and contributors as we do.  Ultimately, though, this is a balancing act: while there will always be some risk involved in an “uncloseting” project like this one, the larger point of the project is to correct the harm of the closeting of LGBTQ+ spaces and the lack of historical memory in our communities.
              </p>
