              <h2>Shifting LGBTQ+ Spaces: User Contribution Disclaimer</h2>
              <p>We welcome and encourage contributions to our dataset! To protect against potentially
                  malicious attacks on our platform and dataset, we require that you agree to not intentionally submit
                  incorrect or false data. Once you agree to these conditions, you may start making contributions
                  to the portal. Note that this process will <b>NOT</b>
                  create a profile for you. We value your privacy and we do not collect any personal information,
                  the passphrase and your contributions will not in any way be associated with your identity.
                  Please also keep in mind that pass phrases will change occasionally for security reasons, so you may
                  need to
                  repeat this process if you wish to make additional contributions to the portal in the future. </p>
              <h2>Ethical Agreement for Contributors</h2>
              <p>Please read the statement below carefully and affirm your commitment to the ethical principles articulated
                  by clicking on the “Agree” tab.  No identifying information will be retained as a result of this action.
                  Affirming your commitment in this way constitutes your agreement to participate ethically in our project
                  on an “honor system” basis:</p><br>
              <p>“I understand that this project involves building and analyzing a historical database of LGBTQ+ spaces and
                  places in the U.S. from the mid-1960s through the mid-2010s.  A larger purpose of the project is to correct
                  the harm caused by the closeting of such spaces and the lack of historical memory in our communities.
                  I also understand that the project necessarily entails a balancing act between protecting the safety,
                  confidentiality, and anonymity of users and contributors and making visible (and therefore potentially vulnerable)
                  spaces and places of LGBTQ+ life that have existed (or, in some cases, may still exist), including, potentially,
                  people associated with them.  I therefore agree that my contributions are, to the best of my knowledge and ability,
                  both accurate and harmless.  I am not knowingly “outing” any spaces, places, or people that I know would object or
                  that could be harmed by doing so.  Nor am I deliberately sabotaging or undermining the goals of the project via my
                  contribution.  Finally, I understand that my contributions will be reviewed for both likelihood of accuracy and
                  appropriateness prior to inclusion in the database, and that inclusion is not guaranteed.”</p>
              <p>(Optional) We would also like to hear what brings you to our platform, your motivations for
                  contributing your knowledge, and your stories about how you came to be familiar with the local
                  community.
                  If your're comfortable sharing any of these, or if there's anything you may want us to know, please
                  let us know in the text field below.
                  Note that this process will <b>NOT</b> affect gaining access to a passphrase.</p>
